# python-chat

This is just a simple chat app project I have been working on the past week.
I wanted to produce a simple TCP/IP chat app using solely Python, and its
inbuilt libraries. To run keep app and client inside same directory, run the server and start app.
Connect using your private network IP. This should be displayed when running the server.
This is my first project posting to GitHub so things may be poor. Thanks.

Should work in Python >= 3.7
